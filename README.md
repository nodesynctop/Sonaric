# Sonaric
Sonaric is an AI-powered network that revolutionizes the way blockchain nodes are operated and managed. Unlike traditional DePINs or compute marketplaces, Sonaric enables node operators to run blockchain nodes on their own hardware, driven by their own interests and incentives.

By combining intelligent automation with a decentralized network, Sonaric makes it easy for anyone to become a node operator, while providing blockchain networks with a reliable and optimized pool of compute resources to support their growth. The network's AI-driven approach ensures optimal performance, security, and rewards for node operators, without the need for complex proof of computation mechanisms.

## Server preparation
```
sudo apt update && apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install wget curl make clang net-tools pkg-config libssl-dev build-essential jq lz4 gcc unzip snapd -y
```
## Install Node
```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/monk-io/sonaric-install/main/linux-install-sonaric.sh)"
```
## Check node info
```
sonaric node-info
```
## Check points
```
sonaric points
```
## Backup Wallet (all in one file) - Pub ID - Priv Key - Seed
```
sonaric identity-export -o wallet.identity
```
`Important:` Save `wallet.identity` file on your server and copied it to your own computer
## Recovery  - You can then import it on a new node using
```
sonaric identity-import -i wallet.identity
```
## Rename node
```
sonaric node-rename
```
## Upgrade node
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade sonaric
sonaric node-info
```
